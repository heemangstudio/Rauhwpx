Establish the document purpose, audience, required facts, tone, and approximate length from the request and existing document.

1. Do not fabricate factual claims, approvals, dates, people, amounts, or institutional policy.
2. Build a clear heading hierarchy and concise Korean office prose.
3. Use actual paragraphs and `apply_list`; never type fake list markers.
4. Reuse existing styles and formatting when available.
5. Insert the draft as ONE `apply_edits` batch in reading order, placing it by `anchor` and adding `render: "crop"` when layout matters. Finish when its `after` shows no warnings.
