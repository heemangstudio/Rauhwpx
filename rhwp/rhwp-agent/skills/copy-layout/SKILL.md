name: copy-layout
description: Turn an HWP or HWPX into a reusable template that preserves its layout, titles, labels, headers, instructions, and other structural guidance while removing filled-in or user-added content. Use when the user asks to copy, extract, preserve, or reuse a Hangul document's layout without completed entries.
---

Create a new `.hwp` or `.hwpx` that remains understandable and ready to fill in. Preserve the reusable document, not merely its empty geometry. Never modify, rename, move, or overwrite the source.

## Owning chat: delegate immediately

When this skill is selected in the main Studio chat, call `get_document_info` once and immediately pass its exact `documentId`, `digest`, `documentName`, `sourceFormat`, `dirty`, and `sourcePath` to `delegate_copy_layout`. The document ID and digest are authoritative; the name is display-only. Never search the filesystem, recent documents, or titles to guess the source, and never ask the user to save, attach, identify, or confirm the document.

Delegate the entire workflow. Do not inspect paragraphs, create decisions, run the helper, publish an artifact, or open a link in the owning chat. `delegate_copy_layout` starts a fresh independent provider session/process in the background and returns immediately, so the main chat stays responsive. It is represented by the normal session/fleet task protocol; it is not a provider-native subagent.

After `delegate_copy_layout` succeeds, do not call `wait_agent`, `list_agents`, poll tools, sleep, or use any other waiting mechanism. Collaboration tools cannot observe this independent process. Briefly tell the user that the background job is running, then end the current turn. The hub will automatically start a new turn in this same owning chat with the structured completion result when the worker settles; that injected turn is the only completion notification to act on.

There is no pre-execution confirmation. Do not ask about paragraph choices, media, privacy ambiguities, destination, format fallback, page-count differences, filename collision suffixes, previews, or publication while the worker runs.

## Dedicated worker: immutable source and bounded autonomy

When `update_copy_layout_job` and `complete_copy_layout_job` are available, you are the dedicated worker. Work without prompting the user or owning agent. Do not spawn or delegate. Call `complete_copy_layout_job` exactly once.

1. Report `binding-source`, read `scripts/copy_layout.py`, and call `get_document_info`. Require its `documentId` and `digest` to equal the trusted job binding. Always call `materialize_document_snapshot`, including when a clean native `sourcePath` exists, and perform every operation against that exact immutable snapshot.
2. Report `inspecting` and call `run_copy_layout_helper` with `action: "inspect"`. Never use Bash, a shell, Python, or another filesystem command to invoke the helper. Inspect the complete paragraph inventory, fields, form controls, named structures, visual marks, and every media use—not a sample.
3. Report `planning` and form a source-SHA-256-bound `textPlan` object with `default: "keep"`. Decide all keep/remove/replace/reset/clear actions before generation.
4. Report `generating` and call `run_copy_layout_helper` with `action: "generate"`, the `textPlan`, and an iteration from 1 through 3. The hub chooses a fresh provider-read-only private candidate path and returns it as `outputPath`; use that exact path for preview and publication. Never write beside the snapshot or source.
5. Report `previewing`. Read the complete helper report, including both `text_decisions.kept` and `text_decisions.removed`, `media_usage`, `removed_body_media`, `delivery`, and native conversion diagnostics. Use `render_page` only for representative first, middle, last, and risk-bearing pages of the bound live source. For the candidate, use the helper report's source-bound native conversion, generated-preview, page/section, geometry, and render-comparison diagnostics; do not invoke a CLI or claim evidence absent from that report. Compare safety, readability, semantic retention/removal, media, pagination, and geometry.
6. Report `converging`. Revise `textPlan` or `keepMedia` evidence and rerun only when it predicts a safer or more faithful result. Stop at verified convergence or after three collision-free candidates with an explicit bounded-no-improvement result.
7. Report `publishing`. Publish exactly one successful final candidate with `publish_artifact`, then submit its exact `artifactId`. Copy every quality, warning, count, representative-page, page/section-count, and verification value exactly from that candidate's helper-owned `candidate_evidence`; the hub rejects altered claims. A best-effort completion is allowed only after all three bounded iterations.
   On hard failure, publish nothing and send only the failure summary/warnings; never invent counts or preview evidence.

Example `textPlan`:

```json
{
  "source_sha256": "<exact snapshot digest>",
  "default": "keep",
  "keep": ["Contents/section0.xml#p0003"],
  "remove": ["Contents/section0.xml#p0012"],
  "replace": { "Contents/section0.xml#p0020": "지출금액" },
  "reset_form_controls": ["Contents/section0.xml#control0004"],
  "clear_border_fill_marks": ["9", "11"]
}
```

The plan is cryptographically bound to the inspected source. Unknown or conflicting IDs are rejected. `keep` and `remove` override the preserve-by-default policy. `replace` may only reproduce fixed source wording while deleting entered content or resetting an obvious mark such as `☑` to `□`; never invent, translate, paraphrase, or improve retained wording.

## Semantic and media decisions

Preserve section/page geometry, paper and margins, columns, headers and footers, master-page graphics, styles, tabs and spacing, tables and cells, borders and fills, text boxes and shapes, object anchoring/wrapping/stacking/rotation/transparency, and zero-width layout anchors.

Keep reusable titles, headings, numbering, captions, column/row headers, category names, fixed options, labels, units, placeholders, signature and approval roles, instructions, warnings, notes, declarations, explanatory guidance, and fixed reference values. Repeated position, styles, table coordinates, bilingual pairs, numbering, nearby empty cells, and label/value relationships are stronger evidence than vocabulary. A field marker is not proof of user input. For mixed paragraphs, keep the exact fixed label and remove only the entered span. If context cannot distinguish guidance from entered content, keep it and report the precise ambiguity as a fidelity/privacy warning; never silently remove reusable guidance.

Remove names, organizations entered into blanks, contact details, selected answers, dates, amounts, identifiers, responses, results, feedback, signatures, stamps, populated charts, photos, scans, and attachments. Reset user-entered form-control state and visual marks such as checks, highlights, colored schedule bars, or data-bearing borders/fills. Keep logos, watermarks, seals, ornaments, and other fixed design media only when the evidence is strong; pass its manifest id in `keepMedia` on a fresh candidate when necessary. Preserve a removed payload's frame and geometry.

Do not rebuild from screenshots or use office-suite/third-party conversion. The helper edits HWPX packages directly and uses Rauhwpx's native HWP→HWPX→HWP pipeline with verified HWPX fallback. It strips scripts, history, rejected payloads, and unsafe previews, then creates the privacy-safe `Preview/PrvText.txt` and `Preview/PrvImage.png` entries required for publication.

## Completion gates

Hard safety/readability gates must all pass: package readability, approved reusable text, absence of rejected text/private payloads, valid structure, readable representative pages, and no source mutation. If any remains unresolved, publish nothing and complete the job as failed with `stoppedReason: hard-failure`.

Page count, pagination, geometry/render similarity, and native-format differences are fidelity checks. Correct them when useful, but after the bounded ceiling a safe and readable candidate may complete as `best_effort` with precise warnings and `stoppedReason: bounded-no-improvement`. Never classify a privacy or readability failure as best effort.

## Owning chat: one final action

The successful structured completion contains the exact immutable artifact, quality, warnings, counts, and representative preview data. Do not open it automatically. Include exactly one Markdown link using the returned `artifact.downloadUrl` with the label `템플릿 미리보기`: `[템플릿 미리보기](<artifact.downloadUrl>)`. Studio renders that link as a document card; only a user click opens the artifact in a new read-only template-preview window.

Report the result concisely, show the card, then ask exactly one final question: whether to save/register this exact artifact as a reusable template. If the user accepts, call `register_copy_layout_template` with the completed `jobId` (and a name only if they supplied one). If the user declines, do not call it; the artifact card remains available without registering a template.
