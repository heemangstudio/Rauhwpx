Read the document structure, then fetch the text ranges needed for a complete summary in one `read_batch`.

1. Distinguish source facts from inference and do not invent missing context.
2. Preserve important names, dates, amounts, decisions, obligations, and exceptions.
3. Match the requested length and format; ask only when the intended audience materially changes the result.
4. Return the summary in chat unless the user explicitly asks to insert it into the document.
5. When inserting, send real paragraphs and `apply_list` in one `apply_edits` and finish when its `after` shows no warnings.
